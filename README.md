# Google_Maps_API

Problem: It is very time consuming to create amenity maps around a single property.

Solution: Using the Google Maps API we can define a point of reference, a radious and the type of amenities we would like to extract. this allows us to generate a json file with the coordinates that we can easily import into maps.

Data: All file paths have been removed and no confidencial data has been released.
